# database-index
Database index implemented through B+ tree. <br />
## Simple user interface: <br />
  0 - Exit <br />
  1 - Create new index or delete one <br />
  2 - Print index <br />
  3 - Add new record in table <br />
  4 - Delete record from table <br />
  5 - Search for one key <br />
  6 - Search for k keys <br />
  7 - Search for k successive keys <br />
  
## Notes: <br />
  - user can create index on tables from testExamples folder
  - since tables are inside document add and delete operations are only done in index (because of inefficiency, later version will be working with sql         tables, and will be changing tables also)
